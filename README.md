# Gianna Williams Computer Vision Project
Using PyTorch for a simple CNN dehazing networks. 

Currently Implemented:
**AOD-Net**: An extremely lightweight CNN MODEL 


**Languages Used:**
1. Pytorch 0.4
2. Python 3 
 

**Preparation:**
NONE SIMPLE RUN THIS USING THE DATA FILE PROVIDED. 
MIGHT NEED TO CHANGE THE PATHS TO SEE THE NETWORK RUN PROPERLY 
PATH SELECTION data/images
**Training:**
1. Run train.py. --> Will drop some validation results into the "samples" folder after every epoch. 
**Testing:**
1. Run dehaze.py.  ---> The script takes images in the "test_images" folder (data folder) and drops the dehazed images into the "results" folder.

Code thats has been edited is seen within the Train.py file. Along with some sythezied images 

Enjoy and have a nice breal :)
